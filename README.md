# lEARN Client

This repository contains the source code for the e-learning android application. It contains **only** the client part of the application. The **server** code is in its separate [repository](https://www.github.com/parkouramit/lEARN-server).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to install Android studio to manage this project. Just follow this [link](https://developer.android.com/studio) and download the software.

You will need to install the SDK for at least **Android M** to make further modifications to this code.

### Installing

After the download of Android Studio ends, you need to install the software. Just follow the installer wizard by clicking **next** on each step and install the software.

Once done, you can open the application by double clicking on its icon and then go to the SDK manager to install the required SDK packages.

Connect your android device to the PC and turn on USB Debugging. If you can install the app in your phone by clicking the run button, you are good to go.

One more thing that you may need to change is the **server ip address**. Go to the config folder and open the **constants** file. Change the ip as per your requirement.

## Deployment

Deployment is simple. Just follow the [google instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish) to publish your app.
